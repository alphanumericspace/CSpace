	printf() and scanf(). By including stdio.h,
	we can use these functions in a C program

		to the standard output (usually the console).
		In this case, "Hello, World!" is a string

	In C, int main() {} is the entry point of a C
	program. It defines the main function, which
	serves as the starting point of program execution.
	The int before main indicates that the function
	returns an integer value to the operating system
	when the program terminates. Within the curly
	braces {}, you write the statements that make up
	the body of the main function.
